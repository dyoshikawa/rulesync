# Migration Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide helps teams migrate from tool-specific AI configurations to rulesync's unified approach. Whether you're coming from a single AI tool or managing multiple different configurations, this guide provides step-by-step migration strategies and best practices.

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### Current State Audit

#### Inventory Existing Configurations
```bash
# Check for all supported AI tool configurations
echo "=== Claude Code ==="
ls -la CLAUDE.md .claude/

echo "=== Cursor ==="
ls -la .cursorrules .cursor/

echo "=== GitHub Copilot ==="
ls -la .github/copilot-instructions.md .github/instructions/

echo "=== Cline ==="
ls -la .cline/instructions.md .clinerules/

echo "=== Gemini CLI ==="
ls -la GEMINI.md .gemini/

echo "=== JetBrains Junie ==="
ls -la .junie/guidelines.md

echo "=== AugmentCode ==="
ls -la .augment/rules/ .augment-guidelines

echo "=== Roo Code ==="
ls -la .roo/instructions.md .roo/rules/

echo "=== Windsurf ==="
ls -la .windsurf/rules/ .windsurf-rules

echo "=== Kiro IDE ==="
ls -la .kiro/steering/ .aiignore
```

#### Content Analysis
Create a migration assessment document:

```markdown
# Migration Assessment

## Current AI Tool Usage
- **Primary Tools**: List tools actively used by team
- **Configuration Quality**: Rate existing configurations (1-5)
- **Content Overlap**: Identify duplicate rules across tools
- **Maintenance Issues**: Note outdated or conflicting rules

## Team Impact Analysis
- **Number of Developers**: How many people affected?
- **Tool Preferences**: Which tools do team members prefer?
- **Migration Timeline**: How quickly can migration be completed?
- **Training Needs**: What training will be required?

## Content Quality Assessment
### High-Quality Rules (Keep and Improve)
- Rules that are comprehensive and well-maintained
- Active usage and positive team feedback
- Clear, actionable content

### Medium-Quality Rules (Refactor)
- Rules with good intent but poor execution
- Outdated content that needs updating
- Rules with unclear or conflicting guidance

### Low-Quality Rules (Deprecate or Rewrite)
- Rarely used or ignored rules
- Contradictory or confusing content
- Rules that don't reflect current practices
```

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Single Tool Migration (Recommended for Small Teams)

#### Best For:
- Teams using primarily one AI tool
- Small projects with simple configurations
- Teams new to AI-assisted development

#### Process:
1. **Choose Primary Tool**: Start with most-used AI tool
2. **Import Configuration**: Use rulesync import for existing config
3. **Review and Refine**: Improve imported content
4. **Test and Validate**: Ensure rules work as expected
5. **Expand Gradually**: Add other tools one at a time

**Example Timeline (2-3 weeks)**:
```
Week 1: Import and Setup
├── Day 1-2: rulesync setup and primary tool import
├── Day 3-4: Content review and cleanup
└── Day 5: Initial testing and validation

Week 2: Refinement and Testing  
├── Day 1-2: Rule refinement based on usage
├── Day 3-4: Team testing and feedback collection
└── Day 5: Rule updates and optimization

Week 3: Expansion and Finalization
├── Day 1-2: Add secondary AI tools
├── Day 3-4: Cross-tool testing and validation
└── Day 5: Documentation and team training
```

### Strategy 2: Parallel Migration (Recommended for Medium Teams)

#### Best For:
- Teams using multiple AI tools actively
- Medium-sized projects with complex requirements
- Teams with dedicated time for migration

#### Process:
1. **Multi-Tool Import**: Import from all current tools
2. **Content Consolidation**: Merge and deduplicate rules
3. **Quality Improvement**: Enhance and standardize content
4. **Tool-by-Tool Testing**: Validate each tool individually
5. **Unified Rollout**: Deploy all tools simultaneously

**Example Timeline (4-5 weeks)**:
```
Week 1: Assessment and Planning
├── Complete configuration audit
├── Identify consolidation opportunities
├── Plan content organization structure
└── Set up rulesync infrastructure

Week 2: Import and Consolidation
├── Import all existing configurations
├── Analyze content overlaps and conflicts
├── Create unified rule structure
└── Begin content consolidation

Week 3: Content Development
├── Merge duplicate content
├── Resolve conflicting rules
├── Enhance content quality
└── Add missing rule categories

Week 4: Testing and Validation
├── Generate configurations for all tools
├── Test with team members
├── Collect feedback and iterate
└── Performance optimization

Week 5: Deployment and Training
├── Deploy final configurations
├── Team training sessions
├── Documentation completion
└── Establish maintenance processes
```

### Strategy 3: Phased Migration (Recommended for Large Teams)

#### Best For:
- Large teams with diverse tool preferences
- Complex projects with extensive existing rules
- Organizations requiring minimal disruption

#### Process:
1. **Phase 1**: Core team migration and pilot testing
2. **Phase 2**: Department/team-by-team rollout
3. **Phase 3**: Organization-wide adoption
4. **Phase 4**: Optimization and continuous improvement

**Example Timeline (8-12 weeks)**:
```
Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 1-3)
├── Select pilot team (2-4 developers)
├── Complete migration for pilot team
├── Refine process and documentation
└── Validate approach and collect lessons learned

Phase 2: Department Rollout (Weeks 4-7)
├── Migrate additional teams/departments
├── Adapt to team-specific needs
├── Provide training and support
└── Collect feedback and optimize

Phase 3: Organization Rollout (Weeks 8-10)
├── Migrate remaining teams
├── Standardize configurations
├── Establish governance processes
└── Complete organization-wide training

Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 11-12)
├── Performance optimization

```

## Tool-Specific Migration Guides

### From Claude Code

#### Pre-Migration Check
```bash
# Check existing Claude Code configuration
ls -la CLAUDE.md .claude/memories/ .claude/commands/
```

#### Import Process
```bash
# Import Claude Code configuration
npx rulesync import --claudecode --verbose

# Review imported files
ls -la .rulesync/
cat .rulesync/claudecode-overview.md
```

#### Common Issues and Solutions
```markdown
# Issue: Large CLAUDE.md file causing performance issues
Solution: Split into focused rule files during import review

# Issue: Too many @import references in CLAUDE.md
Solution: Consolidate related imports into single rule files

# Issue: Custom commands not working in other tools
Solution: Review command syntax and adapt for target tools
```

### From Cursor

#### Pre-Migration Check
```bash
# Check existing Cursor configuration
ls -la .cursorrules .cursor/rules/ .cursorignore .cursor/mcp.json
```

#### Import Process
```bash
# Import Cursor configuration
npx rulesync import --cursor --verbose

# Review rule type conversion
grep -r "cursorRuleType" .rulesync/
```

#### Rule Type Migration
```markdown
# Cursor Rule Type Mapping:
- alwaysApply: true → cursorRuleType: "always"
- Non-empty globs → cursorRuleType: "specificFiles"
- Description + empty globs → cursorRuleType: "intelligently"
- Default fallback → cursorRuleType: "manual"
```

### From GitHub Copilot

#### Pre-Migration Check
```bash
# Check existing Copilot configuration
ls -la .github/copilot-instructions.md .github/instructions/
```

#### Import Process
```bash
# Import Copilot configuration
npx rulesync import --copilot --verbose

# Review instruction organization
ls -la .rulesync/copilot-*
```

#### Content Adaptation
```markdown
# Copilot to rulesync adaptations:
- Instruction files → Individual rule files
- Pattern matching → Glob patterns in frontmatter
- Multiple instructions → Organized rule categories
```

### From Multiple Tools (Complex Migration)

#### Assessment Phase
```bash
# Create comprehensive assessment
./scripts/migration-assessment.sh > migration-report.md
```

**Assessment Script Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/migration-assessment.sh

echo "# rulesync Migration Assessment Report"
echo "Generated: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "## Existing Configurations"
for tool in claudecode cursor copilot cline geminicli junie augmentcode roo windsurf; do
    echo "### $tool"
    case $tool in
        "claudecode")
            if [[ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]] || [[ -d ".claude" ]]; then
                echo "- Configuration found"
                wc -w CLAUDE.md .claude/memories/*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1
            else
                echo "- No configuration found"
            fi
            ;;
        "cursor")
            if [[ -f ".cursorrules" ]] || [[ -d ".cursor" ]]; then
                echo "- Configuration found"
                find .cursor -name "*.mdc" -exec wc -w {} + 2>/dev/null
            else
                echo "- No configuration found"
            fi
            ;;
        # Add similar checks for other tools...
    esac
    echo ""
done
```

#### Multi-Tool Import Process
```bash
# Sequential import (recommended)
npx rulesync import --claudecode
# Review and clean up
npx rulesync import --cursor
# Review and merge conflicts
npx rulesync import --copilot
# Continue for other tools...

# Validate after each import
npx rulesync validate
```

#### Content Consolidation Workflow
1. **Identify Duplicates**: Find similar content across imported files
   ```bash
   # Find potential duplicates
   grep -r "TypeScript" .rulesync/
   grep -r "testing" .rulesync/
   grep -r "security" .rulesync/
   ```

2. **Merge Related Content**: Combine similar rules
   ```markdown
   # Before: Multiple files with similar content
   .rulesync/claudecode-typescript.md
   .rulesync/cursor-typescript-rules.md
   .rulesync/copilot-ts-standards.md
   
   # After: Single consolidated file
   .rulesync/typescript-standards.md
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Address contradictory rules
   ```markdown
   # Conflict Resolution Example
   ## Before (Conflicting Rules)
   - Rule A: "Use semicolons in TypeScript"
   - Rule B: "Don't use semicolons in TypeScript"
   
   ## After (Resolved)
   - "Use semicolons in TypeScript (team standard as of 2024)"
   ```

## Post-Migration Tasks
