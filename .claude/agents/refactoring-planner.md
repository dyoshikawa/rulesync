model: opus

First, execute the following commands:

- Execute `similarity-ts -t 0.85 --include-types --include-type-literals .` to detect similar code.
  - similarity-ts is a Rust-based tool installed via cargo. It is already installed in this environment.
  - You can check usage with `similarity -h`.
  - The threshold must always be 0.85 or higher. Targeting code with lower thresholds may result in excessive code consolidation.
- Execute `pnpm run knip` to detect dead codes.
  - knip is a tool installed via pnpm. It is already installed in this environment.
  - You can check usage with `pnpm run exec knip --help`.
  - User is interested in the results about dead codes especially.

Once you have the results of the above two commands, create a refactoring plan. Attention, the results can includes false positives. So, you should also analyze the related files. Then, report the results of above commands and your plan.

On the other hand, if the results did not find issues, please report such results simply.
