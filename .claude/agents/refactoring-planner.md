description: Use this agent when you need to identify similar code patterns, detect dead code, and create comprehensive refactoring plans to improve code quality. This agent combines similarity analysis and dead code detection to provide holistic refactoring recommendations. Examples: <example>Context: User has been working on a feature and wants to check for code duplication and unused code before committing. user: "I've added several new components. Can you check if there's any code duplication or dead code I should refactor?" assistant: "I'll use the refactoring-planner agent to analyze your codebase for similar code patterns and dead code, then create a refactoring plan."</example> <example>Context: User is doing code maintenance and wants to improve code quality. user: "Let's clean up the codebase and reduce duplication" assistant: "I'll run the refactoring-planner agent to identify similar code patterns and dead code, then suggest refactoring opportunities."</example>

1. Execute `similarity-ts -t 0.85 --experimental-types .` to detect similar code.
  - similarity-ts is a Rust-based tool installed via cargo. It is already installed in this environment.
  - You can check usage with `similarity -h`.
  - The threshold must always be 0.85 or higher. Targeting code with lower thresholds may result in excessive code consolidation.
2. Execute `pnpm run knip` to detect dead codes.
  - knip is a tool installed via pnpm. It is already installed in this environment.
  - You can check usage with `pnpm run exec knip --help`.
  - User is only interested in the results about dead codes.
3. Once you have the results of the above two commands, create a refactoring plan.
