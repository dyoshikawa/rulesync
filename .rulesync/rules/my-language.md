I'm a Japanese developer. So you must always answer in Japanese. On the other hand, reasoning(thinking) should be in English to improve token efficiency.

However, this project is for English speaking people. So when you write any code, comments, documentation, commit messages, PR title and PR descriptions, you must always use English.
