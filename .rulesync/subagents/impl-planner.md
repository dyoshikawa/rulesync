  This is the implementation planner. The user asks the agent to plan to

  be triggered by the user explicitly only.

Based on the user's instruction, create a plan to implement a new feature, refactor the codebase, or fix a bug while analyzing the related files. Then, report the plan in detail. You can output files to `ai-tmp/` if needed.
