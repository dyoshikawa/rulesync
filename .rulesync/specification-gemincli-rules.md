# Gemini CLI Memory (GEMINI.md) Specification

## File Placement
- **Project-level memory**: Place `GEMINI.md` in the root of the repository or project directory
- **Global/user memory**: Optional file at `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` for personal preferences
- **Hierarchical memory**: Multiple GEMINI.md files are concatenated (global first, project last)
- CLI walks up the directory tree to find the first GEMINI.md file

## File Format
- Plain Markdown format - no special frontmatter or JSON required
- Entire file content becomes part of the model context
- Keep under a few thousand tokens for cost efficiency
- Most important guidance should be placed at the top

```markdown
# Project: <name>
Brief project description (2-3 sentences)

## Tech Stack

## Coding Standards
1. Style rules
2. Quality requirements
